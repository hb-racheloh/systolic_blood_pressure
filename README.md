# Is Systolic Blood Pressure Associated with Age and Smoking? A Population-Based Study of American Adults

## Introduction

Blood pressure is read in two numbers, systolic over diastolic, and measured in
millimeters of mercury. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) represents the pressure at the maximum
part of your heartbeat when the heart chambers contract to push blood through your blood
vessels. High blood pressure is defined as SBP of 130 or higher.1 It is a major public health
problem around the world and the leading risk factor for global disease burden, caused nearly
half a million deaths in the United States in 2017.2 Therefore, it is important to know what
causes high SBP.
On average, SBP rises with age.3 While a certain amount of blood pressure increase is
unavoidable as we age, blood pressure health can still be maintained by following the same
lifestyle recommendations as younger people. However, the relationship between smoking and
BP are equivocal, as some studies show a positive association while others show that there is no
relationship. In this study, we are going to investigate the association between age and smoking
and SBP in adults in the U.S.
